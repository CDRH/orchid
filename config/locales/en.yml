      <p>And now, a few words from Star Trek:</p>
      <p>Damage report! Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical
      training. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on
      the ship lately?
      You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you
      tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice.
      In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. Earl Grey tea,
      watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canap√©s? Are you up for promotion?
      Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around
      here. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you.
      Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close
      to us, human history would be far less bloody.</p>
      <p>The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main
      processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat,
      fourteen kiloquad interface modules.
      Well, that's certainly good to know. Well, I'll say this for him - he's
      sure of himself. Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge
      has turned into a swamp.
      A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Computer, belay that
      order. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise.
      Ensign Babyface! Did you come here for something in particular or just
      general Riker-bashing? Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy.
      I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in
      an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will
      not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet.</p>

        <h2 class="sr-only">Search Help</h2>
        <h3>Basic Search</h3>
        <p>Simply enter the word you wish to find and the search engine will
        search for every instance of the word in the journals. For example:
        Fight. All instances of the use of the word fight will show up on the
        results page.</p>
        <h3>Wildcard Searches</h3>
        <p>Using an asterisk (*) will increase the odds of finding the results
        you are seeking. For example: Fight*. The search results will display
        every instance of fight, fights, fighting, etc. More than one wildcard
        may be used. For example: *ricar*. This search will return most
        references to the Aricara tribe, including Ricara, Ricares, Aricaris,
        Ricaries, Ricaree, Ricareis, and Ricarra. Using a question mark (?)
        instead of an asterisk (*) will allow you to search for a single
        character. For example, r?n will find all instances of ran and run, but
        will not find rain or ruin.</p>
        <h3>Capitalization</h3>
        <p>Searches are not case sensitive. For example: george will come up
        with the same results as George.</p>
        <h3>Phrase Search</h3>
        <p>Searching for a specific phrase may help narrow down the results.
        Rather long phrases are no problem. For example: "This white pudding we
        all esteem".</p>
        <h3>Subsequent Searches</h3>
        <p>Because of the creative spellings used by the journalists, it may be
        necessary to try your search multiple times. For example: P?ro*. This
        search brings up numerous variant spellings of the French word pirogue,
        "a large dugout canoe or open boat." Searching for P?*r*og?* will bring
        up other variant spellings. Searching for canoe or boat also may be
        helpful.</p>
