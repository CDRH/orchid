<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p>
  A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Sorry, Data. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? What? We're not at all alike! Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Your head is not an artifact! Shields up! Rrrrred alert! I am your worst nightmare! When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral.
