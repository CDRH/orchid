Damage report! Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canap√©s? Are you up for promotion? Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. Well, that's certainly good to know. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Computer, belay that order. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Ensign Babyface! Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? and attack the Romulans. Besides, you look good in a dress. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet.
