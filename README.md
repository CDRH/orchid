# Orchid

Orchid is a generator which can be used to create a new CDRH API template site.  The new site can either connect to the entire API's contents or filter by "type," meaning that the new site can be used for a specific collection.

**Orchid Documentation can be found [in our documentation repository](https://github.com/CDRH/sneezewort) ([https://github.com/CDRH/sneezewort](https://github.com/CDRH/sneezewort)).** 

Documentation on migration can be found  [on the Migration page](migration.md)
